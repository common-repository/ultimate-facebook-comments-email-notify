This plugin will only work if you have Facebook Social Comments box already installed on your blog... (This plugin will not add any Facebook social comment box on your blog.

HOW DOES IT WORK?

When you install this plugin and activate it... it will listen for an event when you click comment/reply on your Facebook Social Comments Box. 

After clicking the comment button it will post the message, Facebook Profile id , Facebook Profile Name of the commentator using AJAX 
and and a beautiful email notification will be sent to the administrator and the post author.

In case you don't see your email notification in your inbox please check your SPAM folder (Though chances for this to happen is very less).

Finally I have tried helping awesome WordPress family/community with something which can send email notifications when someone comments using Facebook Social Comment Box...

and the best part is THAT IT WORKS...CHEERS :)
